# No Screen Pics
This Discord bot warns a user when they send a crappy screen photo instead of a proper screenshot and tells them to Alt+Print Screen please.

If the bot is unsure it most likely won't react to prevent spamming the chat, pretty much fail safe from my testing but needs more of it. 

**This bot uses AI (ew)**, you might have a personal policy against that. It **does not** collect any data from the users, the dataset is manually curated to not to contain personal info too.
It is trained on 200 images sourced from Reddit and Discord,in the near future I'll make a bigger dataset for it, although its accuracy right now is satisfactory enough. 

Also, the dataset is aimed less at "crappy screen photo"/"screenshot" but more at "eye hurt"/"eye not hurt", these two categories mostly overlap but the latter is far more useful because it doesn't trigger on cases where the focus on the image isn't actually on the screen itself (e.g. [this](https://i.imgur.com/tVyk7Xh.jpeg)) where there is no reason to warn anyone even if it technically contains a crappy screen photo. It is AI that we're talking about though, there is no clear line between those two.

As of 16.04.25 not hosted yet and is in development.
